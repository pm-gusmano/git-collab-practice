## Here is a new readme!

This is a bunch of nonsense and we really don't care. Maybe you should try writing some poetry or some prose?

## Poetry Time!

... yeah I don't do poetry. 

## Prose Time!

## New

Now I'm going to try to this again. Now I forgot to add punctuation. 

# Basic title and details
Things are complicated!
## Birds

So, birds are messy. American Robins can be annoying. Just FYI. Don't piss them off.
